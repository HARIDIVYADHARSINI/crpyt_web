Performing Cryptography using Basic methods such as Substitution techniques and Transposition techniques. 

         One notable cryptography tool website is CrypTool-Online. This platform allows users to explore, experiment with, and learn about both ancient and modern cryptographic techniques. It’s designed to attract students, lecturers, and anyone interested in cryptography1.

Here are some key features of CrypTool-Online:

# 1.Interactive Tools:
Users can play around with various cryptographic algorithms directly in their browser, without needing to download anything.

# 2.Educational Resources:
The site offers step-by-step explanations of complex cryptographic methods like RSA, as well as simpler historical ciphers such as Caesar and Vigenère.

# 3.Cryptanalysis:
Tools for analyzing and breaking different types of ciphers are available, including manual analysis and AI-based identification of cipher types.

# 4.Encoding/Decoding:
Various encoding and decoding tools, such as ASCII and Bacon’s cipher, are provided.

# 5.Checksums and Hashing:
Users can experiment with certificate verification and other hashing techniques.

             CrypTool-Online is part of the larger CrypTool project, which includes other tools like CrypTool 2 for visual programming and cryptanalysis, and MysteryTwister, an international crypto puzzle challenge.
